#### Wake Forest WFU Parallel Machine Learning Group	Winston-Salem, NC
Undergraduate Research Assistant	Spring 2022 – Present
-	Conducted extensive research on **scalable and communication-avoiding** kernel machine learning algorithms (Ridge Regression, SVM, ElasticNets)
-	 Developed novel kernel methods and optimization algorithms and experimented with S-step optimization algorithms to improve kernel function computation and optimization.
-	 Utilized C programming and high-performance computer clusters for parallel computing with OpenMPI.
-	 Performed sparsity analysis and compressed sparse row matrix operations using sparseblas and mkl packages.
-	 Employed libsvm (version 3.31) for dataset selection and model training.
-	 Mentored by Dr. Aditya Devarakonda (devaraa@wfu.edu)
