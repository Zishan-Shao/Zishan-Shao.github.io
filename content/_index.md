## Seeking MS/Ph.D. Opportunities
I'm currently seeking opportunities to be a MS/Ph.D. student at universities focusing on machine learning, communication-efficient algorithms, data science, high-performance computing, and convex optimization. Thrill to collaborate with people from different academic, demographic, ethnical backgrounds and happy to help freshmen, sophormore, juniors who is interested in efficient machine learning algorithms!!


I'm currently seeking research opportunities across broad topics of statistics. I have previous experiences in interdisciplinary areas of statistics/computer science/ and applied mathematics. I have particular interests in statistical & machine learning theory, computing, and efficient algorithms. Thrill to collaborate with people from different academic, demographic, ethnical backgrounds.
